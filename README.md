🌟 I am thrilled to share with you the EasyFood App.

EasyFood is an app that makes making food easier and gives you full information about the selected meal including instructions on how to make that meal provided by a video. 

💡 Libraries and technologies used --»

- Navigation component: one activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activities.

- Retrofit: making HTTP connection with the rest API and converting meal JSON file to Kotlin/Java object. 

- Room: Save meals in the local database.

- MVVM & Live Data: Separate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.

- Coroutines: do some code in the background.

- view binding: instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.

- Glide: Catch images and load them in imageView.
